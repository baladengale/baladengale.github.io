    people.</p>
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>I hold a degree in Computer Science and have experience in
    various programming languages and frameworks. My primary focus is on
    web development, but I also enjoy dabbling in data science and
    machine learning. I believe in continuous learning and strive to
    keep up with the latest trends in technology.</p>
