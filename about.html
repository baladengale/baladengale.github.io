                        <p>Hello! I’m Bala Dengale, a passionate
                        developer and tech enthusiast. I love exploring
                        new technologies and sharing my knowledge with
                        others. My journey in the tech world began with
                        a fascination for coding, and it has evolved
                        into a career where I get to work on exciting
                        projects and collaborate with amazing
                        people.</p>
                        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                        <p>I hold a degree in Computer Science and have
                        experience in various programming languages and
                        frameworks. My primary focus is on web
                        development, but I also enjoy dabbling in data
                        science and machine learning. I believe in
                        continuous learning and strive to keep up with
                        the latest trends in technology.</p>
                        <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
                        <p>In addition to coding, I have a keen interest
                        in open-source projects and contributing to the
                        community. I enjoy writing technical blogs to
                        share insights and tips with fellow developers.
                        When I’m not coding, you can find me reading
                        books, hiking, or experimenting with new recipes
                        in the kitchen.</p>
